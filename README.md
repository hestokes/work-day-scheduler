## Description

Work-Day-Scheduler is a challenge based assignment to create a simple, useful, and clean scheduling option utizling Third Party APIs. This is a straightforward app that stores user entered data in local storage, so that it persists for ease of use.

- The app is color coordinated by time where:

  - <span style="color:#ff6961">Red</span> represents the current time.
  - <span style="color:#77dd77">Green</span> represents the future.
  - <span style="color:#d3d3d3">Grey</span> represents the past.

In creating Work-Day-Scheduler I learned to utilize jQuery and Bootstrap to create a useful application. I also gained some experience with MOMENT.JS in capturing and using real time dates and time.
